#2016 year-average value for SAH1 is 288.230, meaning that shelter cost increased by +188% since 1982-84.

#To compare, Robert Shiller's 20-city house price index went up by +260% from 1983-current. So the housing price index is about 1/3 higher than the shelter cost index. Since housing is 40% of the index, this seems like a noticable difference.
