# so there are two series_ids which differ in the 3rd from last characters
# they are two different "items"

# Note: 1496 or 1486 series in each year/period

# THE MOST DETAILED DATA AVAILABLE
# Note: The series are not mutually exclusive
# There are different sets of mutually exclusive series depending on how far one aggregates
